About Me
---
Hi, I am a 26 year old programmer from Blekinge, Sweden. Where I still currently live and work as a software engineer for Ericsson AB.

The main purpose of this website is for me to have a place where i can keep track of all of my projects. Most of them will be me trying out different things within the frontend space. partially because that is where I do most of my work at my day job, but also because it's often possible to display the full product on a website such as this.

Other interests that could make the site are music and travel.

## Work experience ##
I stated my career at Experis as a "young potential"/consultant working for Ericsson. It was sort of a mix between an internship and a consultant role.

After one year I got hired by Ericsson.
